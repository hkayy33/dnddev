The readme should also include a brief explanation of how the battle simulation works and any assumptions made during the implementation.

# Dragons and Dungeons - hkayy33 Edition

### How it works?
The player is prompted to enter a team name for 2 teams.
- A random team of 3 characters (Cleric / Warrior / Wizard) is generated
- The battle begins 

#### Battle
In battle each character must fight, some having advantages of another (health, attack), the winner of that battle moves on the next round - Winner stays on, you never know what move they can pull, damage is randomised to ensure no winner of a round or entire battle is the same.

## Assumptions Made:
- Each round health is reset to default meaning damage is not carried over.
- Winners are carried down, winner stays on, not a leaderboard type system



### Enjoy Playing!
